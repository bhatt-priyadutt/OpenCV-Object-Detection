# **Project: OpenCV Object Detection**

* In this project, I implemented an image and video object detection classifier using a pretrained yolov3 model. The approach used in the project was to consider bounding boxes that have a greater confidence level(probability) than the confidence threshold (70%) & assign the shape with one of the classes from pre-defined class names. The rectangle bounding boxes are created across the object with the assigning name of the object. The output generated was video/image having detection of the objects that are highlighted with the rectangle.
o	Libraries used: NumPy, OpenCV(cv2), Tkinter
